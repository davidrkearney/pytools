    "- The number of servers that an online service will need next year.\n",
    "- The demand for a grocery product at a supermarket on a given day.\n",
    "- The tomorrow closing price of a tradable financial asset.\n",

    "For another example, we can make a prediction of some team's performance and then use it as a baseline: first to set goals for the team, and then to measure the actual team performance relative to the baseline.\n",

    "There are quite a few different methods to predict future trends, for example, [ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average), [ARCH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity), [regressive models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model), [neural networks](https://medium.com/machine-learning-world/neural-networks-for-algorithmic-trading-1-2-correct-time-series-forecasting-backtesting-9776bfd9e589).\n",

    "In this article, we will look at [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/), a library for time series forecasting released by Facebook and open-sourced on February 23, 2017. We will also try it out in the problem of predicting the daily number of posts published on Medium."
